# OctoGrab
The study of the project lead us to the existing SPHERES robots projects and features developed by the MIT group (and already tested on board the ISS). We will reuse the navigation system of the SPHERES robots, the VERTIGO mapping program and design a new HALO-like dock with a grabbing system with object identification.
